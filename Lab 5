# Executive Summary

In this unit we will learn about data, information and knowledge. We will also learn about the basics of Python and OOP.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
  
  i. What are the methods and the property of the shark class?
  
  The methods for the shark is swimming and awesome and the property of the shark class is sammy(?) or self.
  
  ii. What is the purpose of a constructor?
  
  The purpose of the constructor is to initialize data. It rums as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
  
  iii. What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?"
  
  A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is 
  instantiated from this class. A object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is 
  manifested in the program. Instantiate is to make a object in an OOP language. An intrantiated object is named and created in memory.
  
  # Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
  
  OMG is Object Management Group.UML is a diagram that was created to forge a common visual langauge in the world of software
  development. OMG, is a consortium founded in 1989, it is a task force that develops enterprise integration.
   
  object-definition of a shark, Because the objects is what makes up the class 
  class-shark, Shark is a class because it defines the blueprint created by a programmer for an object.   
  abstraction- to: swim(self) This because it is the action of the real work entity 
  encapsulation-Sammy because this was shark to and if was binded in the data but not shown to the user
  inheritance-a specific type of shark, This is matched because this would be creating a new class   
  
  
  # Data, Information and Knowledge 
  
  ## Relational Data
  
  ### Data, Information and Knowledge 
  
  What is the difference between data, information and knowledge?
  
  Data are the raw bits and pieces of information with no context, knowledge is the consumption of information, and used to make 
  decisions. An informaion is fata that has been interpreted. 
  
  What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table?
  
  My database for a insurance company and my primary key would be a combination of their last name and birthday.
  So the first 4 letters of their last name last 3 of their first name and the last two numbers of their birth year.
  
  
  How would the customers and orders table be related?
  
  This unique ID will be able to related each person individually. 
  
  What would be the foreign key in the orders table?
  
  The foreign key would their user name that was created with their birhtday and first and last names. 
  
  
  The orders table would likely have a date field.Â  
  Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field.
  
  It is important to properlpy define data of a field First, a data type tells the 
  database what functions can be performed with the data. Secondly for storage space.
  
 # Big Data
 
 ## Data, Information and Knowledge
 
 Volume which is the amount of data. Big refers to the huge amount. Velocity, which represents the way the data moves,
 Variety shows the different types of data. And Veracity is used to describe trustworthiness of the data
  
  What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?
  
  The entertainment industry has pushed the need for big data with one example being able to predict if Lebron play or sit.
  
  ## Structured Query Language
  
  Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL
  
  RDBMS is Relational Database Management System which is a program that allow you to create, update and administer a relational 
  database, and this uses a SQl language to access the database. The purpose of SQL is that it is the programming language used
  to communicate with data stored in a relational database.
  
  The primary key in the example above is the customer ID . I think it is this because it is unique to that customer.
  
  ## SQL Injections
  
  SQL is input from the user that is not in the database and the database will run when it should not, this a security threat because
  then a hacker might get unauthorized access to people information. Using parameters is the best thing to remedy this problem. 
  
  # Ethical and Legal Implications 
  
  Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
  
  A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors. The ACM was created so every member will know what
  is expected of each other. It was also the admonition to honest and trustworthy. It also clarifies the acceptable standardsof behaviors 
  for a professional group. 

  Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.)
  
  Many organizations that provide technology services to a group of constituents or the public require agreement to an acceptable 
  use policy (AUP) before those services can be accessed is a set of rules that are not as formal as a code as ethics and company
  will have this
