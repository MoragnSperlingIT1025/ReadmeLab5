  A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is 
  instantiated from this class. A object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is 
  manifested in the program. Instantiate is to make a object in an OOP language. An intrantiated object is named and created in memory.
