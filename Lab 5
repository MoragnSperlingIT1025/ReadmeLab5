# Executive Summary

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
  
  i. What are the methods and the property of the shark class?
  
  The methods for the shark is swimming and awesome and the property of the shark class is sammy(?) or self.
  
  ii. What is the purpose of a constructor?
  
  The purpose of the constructor is to initialize data. It rums as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
  
  iii. What is a class vs. an object and what does it mean to "instantiate an object from a class?"
  
  A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is 
  instantiated from this class. A object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is 
  manifested in the program. Instantiate is to make a object in an OOP language. An intrantiated object is named and created in memory.
  
  # Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
  
  OMG is Object Management Group.UML is a diagram that was created to forge a common visual langauge in the world of software
  development. OMG, is a consortium founded in 1989, it is a task force that develops enterprise integration.
   
  object-definition of a shark, Because the objects is what makes up the class 
  class-shark, Shark is a class because it defines the blueprint created by a programmer for an object.   
  abstraction- to: swim(self) This because it is the action of the real work entity 
  encapsulation-Sammy because this was shark to and if was binded in the data but not shown to the user
  inheritance-a specific type of shark, This is matched because this would be creating a new class
